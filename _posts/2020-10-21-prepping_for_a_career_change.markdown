I have been working through the Flatiron School material "at my own pace" for about a month now and doing so at a fast rate. I need to. My job is that I am a minor league professional ice hockey player. That came to a screeching halt in March when every league across the globe was shut down. At first, I thought it was all a big overreaction and that I would be getting called to finish the season in April. That never happened. So I got myself a summer job as I normally would have and continued on. As the summer went on, I worried more and more about the upcoming season. When would it start? Would it even happen at all? What was I going to do if there was no season in the fall or winter?

I went to college for exercise science with the intention of becoming a strength and conditioning coach for a college, professional, or junior hockey team. But after a while of on the floor coaching experience, I realized that I could not see myself with that booming voice to motivate athletes to hit their personal bests. I knew the mechanics behind it all and how to program a workout, but the floor presence was lacking and just was not developing. I thought of myself as equals with these athletes because I still had not given up on my dreams of playing further. In reality, the education I got was really only so that I could train myself and those who go to the gym with me. So after taking a chance and making a minor league pro team, I went all in on that. Unfortunately, my window of opportunity to keep playing and "climbing the ladder" has gotten much smaller due to the cancelled season and delayed start (if there is a start) of the upcoming season.

I needed another plan. Luckily, I met a Flatiron Graduate through a mutual friend over the summer and he gave me some more info on the program so I looked into it, applied, and got in. I knew going into this that there were two options (because living off of minor league salary just doesn't work).

1. IF there is a season my plan is to take a break from this course and go all in to my playing career with the hopes of advancing to the next level and playing at the highest level possible. Which means I will come back to this course after the season is over and finish it during the offseason. 

2. If there is no hockey this winter, I plan on finishing this course as efficiently as possible and beginning to search for a job. Like I said before, I can't live off a minor league salary forever. 

There is still no schedule for my league, which was playing its first games this time last year. Until something happens, I'll be chipping away at the coursework and keeping up with everyone here.
