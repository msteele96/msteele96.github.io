For my fourth project I made my own version of the classic game of Snake. My thinking is typically very backend oriented so naturally I set up the skeleton frontend and generated my Rails API, then went to work on the backbone. I knew I would need scores and users so I was able to quickly get my models and db set up. I did a basic outline of what I might need in the controllers and transitioned to the front end. The vast majority of my time was spent on the frontend side where I struggled to get CSS to cooperate with me and then struggled some more to figure out how to make the snake actually slither and lengthen as it ate the food. Eventually it all came together to a point where I think the best step is to get another set of eyes on the code so that I can see where some weaknesses may be handled and hopefully after a review I can be sure that I have put out a really decent product that demonstrates communication between frontend and backend, and something that is clean to watch while the snake moves around and eats the food.
