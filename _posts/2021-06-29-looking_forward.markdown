Now that I am on the final project for my Flatiron Career, I am naturally looking forward to job searching and I have noticed a pattern with a lot of the openings that I am seeing. Many of the jobs are looking for experience in JS and Python. Seeing that this course gives us a lot of experience working with JS, I think I am going to dedicate some time to learning Python after completing the last project. I know that no matter what, there will be a learning curve when it comes to getting a job, but I'm hoping that some experience in Python will be appealing enough to potential employers and show them that I am trying to he as versatile as possible until I am given a certain area of expertise. When that job offer does finally come, I plan to learn as much as possible about the environment that I will be working in and at that point, I would try to establish more expertise in a given area. All this being said, I am looking forward to completing this final project and moving into the next portion of this process in career prep and having a portfolio to show my growth over the past few months.
